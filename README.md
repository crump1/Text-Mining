SCIFI Project

Took three classic sci-fi books and put them through a full text analytics workout. 

Books:

Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea - Jules Verne
The War of the Worlds - H.G. Wells
A Princess of Mars - Edgar Rice Burroughs

Techniques included:

1.) Word frequency - including frequency correlation

2.) Topic modeling

3.) TF-IDF

4.) Sentiment analysis

5.) Lots of EDA/visualization

Mostly utilized the newer "tidy" approach to text analytics in R. Much more robust data transformation. 

Turns out, War of the Worlds is truly doom and gloom. But Leagues has a steady beat throughout the book. A nice rhythm of positive and negative sentiment to keep the reader moving. Burroughs book was different in many ways, and did not correlate highly with - at least - Verne at all. Princess of Mars is funky anyway, bouncing between seemingly different genres, yet keeping it's pulp fiction flair. 






Sherlock Project

A quick text analysis of some of Arthur Conan Doyle's work. I think Sherlock Holmes would have approved of a more scientific approach to analyzing his detective work.
